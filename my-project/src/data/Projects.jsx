The application integrates features like password encryption for secure user management, AJAX for dynamic page updates, and a MySQL database for storing user, pet, and order information. Designed with a user-centric approach, the platform ensures a seamless shopping experience with interactive elements and a fully responsive layout, making it accessible across devices.
